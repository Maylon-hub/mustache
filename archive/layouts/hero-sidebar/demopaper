What's the problem?
Why is it hard? Compute 
DBSCAN -> minpts + epsilon
HDBSCAN -> minpts
Oracle to produce all the hierarchies

meta cluster of hierarchies
ranges that produce similar hierarchies

This problem can be solved with the ICDM paper

Metaclustering to group similar hierarchies

What can I do about it?
- Distance Matrix

Focus on visualization.
